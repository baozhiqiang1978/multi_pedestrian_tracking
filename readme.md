# multi_pedestrian_tracking
...in python...
A multi-pedestrian tracker as proposed in the paper:

FÃ¼hr, G. ; Jung, C. R. Combining Patch Matching and Detection for Robust Pedestrian Tracking in Monocular Calibrated Cameras. Pattern Recognition Letters (Special Issue). 2013.

The aim is to translate the MATLAB source-code in gustavofuhr/multi_pedestrian_tracking into PYTHON.
